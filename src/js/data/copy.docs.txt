Idriss Saleh hasn’t forgotten his freshman year teachers at Universal Academy, but he doesn’t know if they remember him.
By the time his senior year began this fall, none of the seven teachers who helped him kick off what he views as “the most important four years” of his life were still at the school.
“They didn’t stick with us,” Saleh said. “ I don’t know why.”
In four years at Universal Academy, a K-12 charter school in Detroit, Saleh got used to seeing a lot of new faces at the front of the classroom. Teacher turnover exceeded 50% in each of his first three years. Just 7 of the 31 educators who worked at the upper school when he was a freshman were still there by the end of his junior year. Teachers often left in the middle of the year and were replaced by long-term substitutes.
Dozens more schools in Detroit — and many more in low-income communities statewide — are contending with troublingly high rates of teacher turnover. Frequent disruptions at the front of the classroom, driven by low pay and poor working conditions, take a steep toll on student learning, research shows. This burden falls almost exclusively on Michigan’s most vulnerable students.
[]
[+graphic1]
step1: Consider Universal Academy, where XX% of students are economically disadvantaged. In the fall of 2015, the school employed 32 teachers.

step2: Four years later, only five of the original teachers remained. During that time, the annual teacher turnover rate ranged from 33% to 63%. By comparison, 18% of Michigan teachers change schools or leave the profession in a typical year.

step3: Where are those teachers going? Some are going to other charter schools.

step4: Some are going to traditional schools.

step5: Some retire or decide to no longer teach in Michigan. 

step6: Making matters worse, XX teachers left in the middle of the year during the same period. Research in North Carolina suggests that midyear teacher turnover is [especially detrimental to student learning](https://www.chalkbeat.org/2018/10/23/21105948/new-research-shows-just-how-much-losing-a-teacher-midyear-hurts-students).

Saleh managed to keep his grades up, maintaining a 3.9 GPA. But as he prepares to submit college applications, he wonders if the revolving cast of teachers at Universal Academy prepared him for higher learning.
“Even though I worked hard to get to where I am, I feel like I'm still at a disadvantage entering college,” he said.
Through a spokesman, Universal Academy said its turnover rate between last year and the current school was only 8%, and said that number should speak for itself. (That data is not yet publicly available.)
But with experts predicting a spike in teacher departures after the pandemic, teacher churn is not going away.
Consider: 181,000 Michigan students attended a school with teacher turnover of 30% or more in 2017-2018. That means 12% of students in the state attend schools with very high rates of churn at the front of the classroom.
Almost all of them are among the students who most benefit from stability at school.
Seventy-one percent of students in high turnover schools were economically disadvantaged. Black students, who made up just 18% of statewide enrollment, accounted for 45% of students in schools where teachers were least likely to stick around.

step1: Detroit has a lower teacher retention than the statewide average.

step2: Other similar cities across the state also struggle with teacher retention.

step3: Especially when compared to wealthier suburbs that are able to retain a much higher percentage of their teachers. 
[]
[+text3]
Those students likely paid a steep — and preventable — price for the inconsistency at the front of the classroom, according to decades of [research](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0002831212463813) on [teacher turnover](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027277571530087X).
“If you don’t address the turnover problem, nothing else is going to work,” said Ed Fuller, an education professor at Penn State University who helped design a teacher retention policy in Austin, Tx. “It’s just not possible to have a functioning school with” very high levels of turnover.
High teacher turnover has been linked to lower student performance in several studies. The damage is most severe when teachers leave mid-year, a phenomenon that is all too common in Detroit, a Chalkbeat analysis found.
Some turnover is to be expected in any workplace and is likely beneficial, but numerous studies show that teacher turnover is different because of the costs it imposes on students. When teachers leave — whether it’s for another school or another profession — they take their knowledge of the school community with them. They interrupt classroom routines and sever relationships with students, parents, and colleagues that are the essential “[connective tissue](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7275360-ELED-RelationalTrustInSchools-1115.html)” that makes schools run.
“That instability, it breaks communities,” said Darrin Camilleri, a Demoratic state representative who began his career teaching social studies at a high-turnover charter school in Detroit. “One of the joys of Michigan’s education history was that so many people had teachers who stayed in the classroom for 30 or 35 years. They taught their students’ parents. You still see that in some schools, but you’re losing that sense of community in so many other schools.”
“And community is a huge part of how you support students.”

Turnover across Detroit — like other cities with high poverty and jobless rates — is also troublingly high.

And disruptive midyear departures are also troublingly common, with XX teachers leaving midyear during that time.

header1: A systemic problem
[+text4]
Teachers leave their jobs for many reasons, which researchers often describe using the umbrella term “working conditions.” These conditions include pay, the amount of training teachers get, their principal, their sense of job security, and the condition of school buildings and learning materials. A recent study found that the single greatest predictor of teacher turnover is whether educators feel they are successful in their jobs.
Camilleri blames turnover at his former school on a lack of support for teachers. His students at Voyageur College Prep were among the state’s most vulnerable — more than 80% were economically disadvantaged. Yet he sometimes felt powerless to meet their needs.
“We oftentimes didn’t have the resources to support our students,” he said. “We did not have enough counselors, we did not have enough social workers.”
Poor working conditions lead to turnover, which often leads to more turnover in a vicious cycle that is one of the “driving issues” behind the travails of the state’s lowest performing schools, said Katharine Strunk, a researcher at Michigan State University who co-authored a new [report](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7245062-EPIC-Report-Yr2-PartRpt10-15-20.html) on those schools.
“It’s a double-edged sword,” she added. “You’re trying to turn around your school, maybe buying new curriculum, investing in new training and instructional techniques. And you’re kind of wasting your money because teachers are leaving.”
Ending the pattern of turnover in Detroit and other low-income communities would likely require one of a number of  [system-wide investments](https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/blog/why-addressing-teacher-turnover-matters) that researchers suggest would reduce turnover for low-income schools. The state could also decrease class sizes, fund high-quality new teacher training programs, or pay for school staff — paraprofessionals, counselors, and social workers — who give teachers the freedom to focus on teaching.
“Apart from really systematic investment in schools, it’s going to be hard to improve working conditions meaningfully,” said Lucy Sorensen, a professor at the State University of New York - Albany who has [studied](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7230048-The-Hidden-Costs-of-Teacher-Turnover.html) teacher turnover. “To the extent that urban schools are less funded, higher stress work environments, serving students with greater needs, that’s more likely to cause teachers to depart.”
But systematic investment would be expensive, and school spending seems unlikely to rise sharply in the midst of a recession.
[]
header2: Salary matters
[+text5]
While salary isn’t the main reason teachers leave schools, low teacher pay in many schools that serve low-income students almost certainly contributes to high turnover in those schools.
Compared to other states, Michigan teacher pay is [slightly above average](https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/product/understanding-teacher-shortages-interactive). Still, labor leaders point out that school funding has [declined](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6770487-Michigan-School-Finance-at-the-Crossroads-a.html#document/p5/a586552), and teachers receive less help from classroom aides and social workers. Those issues drove a national wave of teacher strikes in2018, and national polls show that a strong majority of Americans think that [teachers in general need a raise](https://pdkpoll.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Poll52-2020_PollSupplement.pdf).
“From our perspective there are a number of things that can be done about teacher turnover, but a core way is to pay teachers what they deserve to be paid,” David Hecker, president of the Michigan Federation of Teachers, said.
Schools that enroll lots of low-income students receive [less state funding than their more affluent counterparts](http://schoolfinancedata.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Profiles17_MI.pdf) and typically pay teachers less.
The result is stark pay differentials that make it difficult for teachers to stay in some schools with very high need students.
This dynamic has reached an extreme in Detroit. Three years ago, when Superintendent Nikolai Vitti took the reins at the Detroit Public Schools Community District, one of his top priorities was filling hundreds of vacant teaching positions. He succeeded, mostly by finding ways to increase teacher salaries: The district’s starting salary is now among the highest in the state at more than $51,000??.
However, charter schools in Detroit and some districts in inner-ring suburbs receive less funding on average than the city district, especially after a quirk in the federal coronavirus relief package sent a disproportionate amount of aid to the city district.
That means neighboring schools in Detroit sometimes pay teachers drastically different amounts. A starting teacher at Marin L. Winans Academy, a charter school, might make about [half as much](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7275521-Winans-Salary-Bands.html) as their peers at a district-run Wayne Elementary School seven blocks away. 
The result is [fierce competition for teachers](https://www.detroitjournalism.org/2017/12/05/fight-teachers-weakens-detroit-schools/), and students are losing the most. [Research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0002831212463813) links high levels of turnover with academic struggles, especially for low-income students and students of color.
ADDONIZIO COMMENT??
Many of the Detroit district’s new teachers moved from inner-ring suburbs and charter schools in the city, including Universal Academy, according to a Chalkbeat analysis. While some charters were able to match the district’s salary increases, they were in the minority. One charter leader accused the district of [“lur[ing] charter teachers away.”](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7230042-Madeline-Black-Education-Equity-an-Empty-Notion.html#document/p2/a585574)
VITTI COMMENT??
[]
[+graphic4]
step1: Between 2015 and 2019, XX teachers moved from Detroit charters to the city district.

step2: The number increased after 2017, when Vitti began implementing a range of policies to increase pay for teachers all along the pay scale.

Lamar Phillips, a music teacher, said he left his job at Detroit Merit Charter Academy because he didn’t feel the charter school supported his band program. What’s more, he felt he wasn’t being adequately compensated as a teacher with a masters degree who devoted long hours to his students. He chose to move to a school in the Detroit Public School Community District.
“You’re talking about four, five, six, seven thousand dollars more, and there’s a union,” he said.
That hasn’t helped turnover in charter schools, which tended to be high even before Vitti’s pay reforms.
All but 3 the 25 Detroit schools with the worst teacher turnover in 2017-2018 were charter schools.
Students at charter schools in Detroit perform better on average than their peers in the Detroit district, though they still lag far behind state averages. Janelle Brzezinski, a spokeswoman for Central Michigan University’s charter school center, acknowledged that turnover isn’t ideal, especially if it occurs midyear.
But she said that high turnover isn’t necessarily a problem.
“While consistency in a student’s daily education is always the goal, it may not be appropriate to infer that all turnover is negative especially when occurring between school years,” she said.
Thirty-one charter schools overseen by CMU posted teacher turnover rates of 30% or higher in 2017-2018. About half of K-8 schools in that group posted below-average mean student growth score of 45 or lower.
That year, 24 CMU schools lost more than 10% of their teachers in the middle of the school year.
Brzezinski’s focus on turnover between years — as opposed to the middle of the year — lines up with new research suggesting that midyear teacher turnover imposes especially harsh costs on student learning.
The authors of a 2018 [study](https://www.chalkbeat.org/2018/10/23/21105948/new-research-shows-just-how-much-losing-a-teacher-midyear-hurts-students) in North Carolina found sharp declines in math scores when teachers left in the middle of the year. The size of the decline was nearly as large as the difference between an average teacher and an excellent one. By contrast, the effect of teachers changing schools in the summer was much smaller; in some cases, those departures actually improved student performance.

Those numbers only include one teacher switch per year and thus may underestimate the scope of midyear turnover.
“One year my daughter had three science teachers,” Bernita Bradley, a Detroit parent and education advocate. “This was literally from September to January. Every time they had a new teacher, my daughter and her peers had to learn the new teacher’s structure — ‘how do you teach, what do you expect from us?’ It’s like starting all over again.”

header3: One crack in a leaky pipeline
[+text8]
Experts have been sounding alarms for years about cracks in Michigan’s teacher pipeline, pointing out that fewer people are entering teacher training programs and becoming certified as educators. Headlines periodically warn of a “teacher shortage.” The use of uncertified, long-term substitute teachers has skyrocketed.
“Teacher turnover is only part of the teacher supply chain equation,” said Jack Elsey, executive director of the Detroit Children’s Fund, a nonprofit. “The percentage of teachers who are enrolling in teacher prep, the number of people going into teaching — all of those metrics scare the pants off me.”
The problems in the teacher labor market are intertwined, Elsey said. If more people became teachers, it would be easier to replace teachers when they left. When lots of teachers leave, you need more new teachers.
Turnover is expensive in more ways than one: There’s little doubt that it has contributed to Michigan’s twenty-year backslide in academic performance, likely leading to lower earnings for students and greater social service costs.
Turnover itself also costs a lot of money. For each teacher who leaves, school must spend money to recruit, hire, and train a replacement. In North Carolina, a state with roughly as many K-12 students as Michigan, researchers [estimated](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7230038-Administrative-Cost-of-Turnover-Summary.html) that schools spent $337 million on turnover-related administrative costs in a single year.
Policymakers and advocates in Michigan have repeatedly turned their focus to teacher turnover. The new state budget offers a small bonus for first year teachers in high-need schools. State education officials have raised alarms about the issue in numerous [reports](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7230047-Teacher-Mobility-Brief-Final-2017-09-18-v2-Ada.html), and the State Superintendent Michael Rice hosts a regular meeting with education leaders about the teacher labor market. In Detroit, a philanthropic effort called Teach313 strives to highlight the work of successful teachers in hopes of raising the profession’s appeal.
But experts generally agree that any major change to the teacher labor market would require a substantial new investment in schools, one the Republican-controlled legislature has shown little interest in making.
“We tend to make the story too much about the people and not enough about the context in which they’re expected to work,” said Barbara Schneider, a sociologist at the University of Michigan who studies teacher turnover.
“It’s a resource issue.”
REPUBLICAN COMMENT FORTHCOMING ??

header4: Turnover and the pandemic
[+text9]
Towards the end of the first pandemic summer, pollsters working for the American Federation of Teachers, an educator’s union, published a [dismaying finding](https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/survey_school-reopening_augsept2020.pdf). 1 in 3 teachers said that they were more likely to leave teaching or retire early because of COVID-19.
Even if only some of those teachers actually left, such an exodus would add to the educational tragedy unfolding as a result of the pandemic. Many children have already fallen behind in seven months away from classrooms, and a spike in teacher turnover would cement a catastrophic loss of student learning for the state’s most vulnerable students.
Such a spike remains a big “if,” at least until the pandemic recession wanes. Sorensen noted that teacher turnover appeared to decrease in some states during the last recession, perhaps because teachers felt there were fewer other jobs available.
Still, the coronavirus has massively disrupted many teachers’ work lives, forcing them to adopt new roles and methods — such as online instruction — for which they have little training and which bear little resemblance to the job they signed up to do. Teachers understandably feel that they’re not succeeding in their jobs during the pandemic, according to a new paper co-authored by Nicole Simon, a researcher affiliated with the Project on the Next Generation of Teachers, an initiative at Harvard University.
“All of the things that drive teachers out of the profession… are happening at extremely alarming rates right now,” Simon said. “My prediction is that we’ll see a mass exodus from teaching.”

header5: Not all turnover solutions are expensive
[+text10]
What can be done? Even in the absence of any major reform, many experts argue that it’s possible to reduce turnover, to an extent, through seemingly small steps like simply asking teachers to stay. They point out that turnover varies widely [even among schools that receive similar funding and serve similar students](https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/blog/why-addressing-teacher-turnover-matters). In Detroit, for example, 39 schools retained more than 85% of their teachers in 2017-2018.
What sets those schools apart? Often it’s communication, Sorensen said.
“People in the education field have not done enough of the simple task of asking teachers what they need and what the difficulties are in their everyday jobs,” she added.
That’s the concept behind Upbeat, a company founded in XXX that consults with school districts about reducing teacher turnover. The company is premised on the idea that teachers and school leaders often aren’t on the same page. Upbeat surveys teachers anonymously to identify their frustrations, then shares the results with administrators.
“If teachers are involved in shaping the rules and procedures that govern their work days, they’re more likely to buy in,” said Henry Wellington, CEO of Upbeat. “If their performance evaluations are considered fair, they feel more successful. And we know that when teachers feel more successful they’re more likely to stay.”

header6: Principals matter

[+text11]
To be sure, schools don’t need to hire an outside firm to create a strong internal culture.
This work can be done just as easily by school staff and, crucially, by the school principal.
Again and again, researchers find that principals have an outsized impact on teachers’ sense of success and the likelihood that they’ll leave.
Sean McCauley began his math teaching career at Old Redford Academy middle school, a charter in Detroit. He eventually left because he wasn’t getting enough from his principals, who seldom stuck around long enough to build a working relationship.
“I taught there for five years and I think I had six principals in that time,” he said. “I really liked some of the principals and I was excited for them to put their imprint on the school, and then in a year they’d be gone.”
McCauley’s case shows how high turnover of principals and teachers can combine to destabilize an entire school.
Principals play a huge part in shaping teachers’ experiences at work, and researchers consistently find that they are a crucial piece in retaining teachers. Turnover was a “formidable challenge” for Michigan’s troubled schools, according to a recent study of the state’s school turnaround program. Teachers in those programs listed school leadership as the [single most important reason](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7245062-EPIC-Report-Yr2-PartRpt10-15-20.html#document/p169/a586607) they would stay or go.
That’s one reason why some efforts to improve teacher turnover begin with principals: the Detroit Children’s Fund, for instance, has helped fund a [training program](http://detroitchildrensfund.org/our-investments/talent-investments/) for principals in the city.
Turnover at Old Redford was persistently high — of 20 teachers who began the school year in 2015, including McCauley, only two were left by the fall of 2019.

step1: Between 2015 and 2019, XX teachers left the Old Redford network for traditional schools in suburban Detroit. (show old redford (whole district) to trad suburban)

step2: Another XX moved to the traditional district in Detroit. (show old redford to Detroit district)

step3: Across Detroit, teachers are most likely to move from charter schools to traditional schools (highlight this trend citywide) — or to leave the city entirely for suburban schools (highlight this trend) — than the other way around.

[+text12]
Few of the teachers who stayed were experienced enough to mentor an early-career teacher like McCauley. A few years after he started teaching, he was asked to serve as a mentor for other, newer teachers.
That’s when he began looking for another job. He felt he was too new himself to be a mentor.
He now teaches at Berkshire Middle School, a traditional public school in Birmingham, an affluent suburb of Detroit.
The year after he left, the school received two Fs from the state for student proficiency and growth.
Old Redford was taken over by a new management company in 2019, Superintendent Sabrina Claude McGahee said in an email.
She said the network tries to hold on to teachers using bonuses for teachers who work in hard-to-staff schools and training programs that are tailored to individual teachers’ needs. Noting that the network’s teacher salaries are roughly 80% of the regional average, she said she focuses on hiring teachers who are committed to the school’s mission.
“While some teachers may be attracted to financial incentives, we focus on creating a positive climate and culture with support from administration so we can attract and retain highly qualified talent who are committed to our mission of educating students in an urban environment,” she said.

header7: A place to stay
[+text13]
The person who stands out most in Idriss Saleh’s memories of freshman year is his U.S. History teacher, Ben Kruid.
“That first year bond was amazing, I remember having a good time,” Saleh said. We actually accomplished things when he taught.”
Kruid played old movies related to the subjects they were studying, and he often gave students a choice between taking tests or doing a project to demonstrate their learning. As Saleh prepares to apply to college, he wonders if, in a different world, Kruid might have written him a letter of recommendation.
“It would have even been nice to see him in the hallways,” Saleh said. “Even if he wasn’t teaching my class. I’m pretty sure I’m not the only one who feels that way.”
Kruid remembers Saleh as a “hard worker” and their class, U.S. History 9B, as a “ton of fun.” The class started out slowly, hampered by behavioral issues, but Kruid says the students bought in when he began allowing them to demonstrate their learning through projects rather than tests.
History 9B was a high point of Kruid’s chaotic first year as a teacher in the United States. He grew up in Michigan and graduated from a liberal arts college in Grand Rapids, then taught English for several years in China and earned a masters degree in education in Finland.
Those experiences did not prepare him to work in a school staffed by [novice](https://bit.ly/3jjVtoE) or [underqualified](https://bit.ly/3jkm70C) teachers who were likely to leave within a year, he said.
“Most of the problems [at Universal Academy] stem from teacher turnover. The students, by the time they get to middle school, they’ve seen so much of it that they don’t seek a connection with their teacher, because why bother? The teachers are just going to leave the school.
“From a teacher’s point of view, if you don’t have a relationship with your students, you’re lost. You’re spending all your time on classroom management.”
Kruid left after one year. [Two-thirds](https://bit.ly/3ofUkCf) of teachers at the school left that year, too.
He says he was conflicted about leaving. He had grown fond of Saleh and his peers in 9B. He wrestled with feelings of guilt. Was he abandoning them?
In the end, he decided he was being asked to do the impossible. He felt teachers weren’t getting enough support from school leaders to deal with school behavior. Many families only spoke Arabic, but non-Arabic-speaking teachers didn’t get nearly enough translation help to communicate with their students’ parents, he recalled.
?? UA COMMENT
While he felt the administration at Universal Academy could have done more, he said the teachers across the state are being asked to meet growing student needs without enough support. “We’re being more and more asked to raise the children as well as teach them,” he said.
The next year, he found a job at an unusual new school in the Grand Rapids district. It was based in a museum and had recently [received a $10 million grant](https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/2016/09/embargo_1.html) for innovative schools from [XQ](https://www.chalkbeat.org/2019/11/6/21121848/how-sometimes-overhyped-claims-about-the-future-of-work-drive-xq-the-organization-helping-nyc-open-n), a philanthropic initiative backed by Laurene Powell Jobs. The school used a “mastery” system, doing away with grades and allowing students to advance based purely on their proficiency. Kruid taught classes in Curation & Museum Sciences; he used objects from the museum to teach history lessons.
The new job was exciting, he said. But that’s not why there is minimal turnover at the school, or why he hopes to teach there for the rest of his career.
“There are a lot of cool things that make me want to stay,” he said, “but the biggest is that I get support from my principal and administration when I need it.”
